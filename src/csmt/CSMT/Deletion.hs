-- Description : Deletion algorithm for Compact Sparse Merkle Trees
-- Copyright   : (c) Paolo Veronelli, 2024

--
-- This module implements the deletion algorithm for CSMTs.
--
-- The deletion process:
--
-- 1. Build a 'DeletionPath' representing the path to the value being deleted
-- 2. Convert the path to database operations (deletions and updates)
-- 3. Apply all operations atomically
--
-- When a value is deleted, the tree structure may need to be compacted
-- by extending jump paths where branches become unnecessary.

-- * 'Value' - The leaf node containing the value to delete
-- * 'Branch' - An internal node along the path, recording the sibling
--   that will need to be updated after deletion
--
-- This structure captures the entire path from root to leaf, which is
-- needed to properly update parent hashes after deletion.

-- 1. Builds a deletion path from root to the target key
-- 2. Removes the key from the KV store
-- 3. Updates the tree structure and recomputes affected hashes
