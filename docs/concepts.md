# Concepts

This page explains the key concepts behind MTS and its two trie implementations.

## Merkle Trees

A Merkle tree is a tree where:

- Each leaf node contains the hash of a data block
- Each internal node contains the hash of its children

```mermaid
graph TD
    Root[Root Hash] --> L[Hash AB]
    Root --> R[Hash CD]
    L --> A[Hash A]
    L --> B[Hash B]
    R --> C[Hash C]
    R --> D[Hash D]
```

This structure enables **Merkle proofs** - compact proofs that a specific piece of data is part of the tree. To prove inclusion of data A, you only need:

1. Hash of A
2. Hash B (sibling)
3. Hash CD (uncle)

With these three hashes, anyone can recompute the root and verify the proof.

## MTS: The Shared Interface

MTS defines a common `MerkleTreeStore` GADT that abstracts over the trie
implementation. Type families determine the concrete key, value, hash, proof,
leaf, and completeness proof types for each backend:

| Operation | Type |
|-----------|------|
| `mtsInsert` | `MtsKey imp -> MtsValue imp -> m ()` |
| `mtsDelete` | `MtsKey imp -> m ()` |
| `mtsRootHash` | `m (Maybe (MtsHash imp))` |
| `mtsMkProof` | `MtsKey imp -> m (Maybe (MtsHash imp, MtsProof imp))` |
| `mtsVerifyProof` | `MtsValue imp -> MtsProof imp -> m Bool` |
| `mtsBatchInsert` | `[(MtsKey imp, MtsValue imp)] -> m ()` |

`mtsInsert`/`mtsDelete` live in the `MtsKV` record (both modes); the
remaining operations live in `MtsTree` (`Full` mode only). Application
code written against `MerkleTreeStore mode imp m` works with either
CSMT or MPF. See [MTS Interface](interface.md) for the full API.

## Sparse Merkle Trees

A Sparse Merkle Tree (SMT) is a Merkle tree where:

- Keys determine the path through the tree (each bit = left or right)
- Most leaves are empty (hence "sparse")
- The tree depth equals the key length in bits

For a 256-bit key, a naive SMT would have 2^256 possible leaves - far too large to store explicitly.

## CSMT: Compact Sparse Merkle Tree

The CSMT is a **binary trie** that optimizes storage through path compression:

1. **Path compression**: Empty subtrees are not stored
2. **Jump paths**: Instead of storing each node on the path, we store a "jump" directly to where the data diverges

### Path Compression Example

Consider inserting keys `LLRR` and `LRRL`:

**Without compression** (naive SMT):
```
Root -> L -> L -> R -> R -> value1
     -> R -> R -> L -> value2
```

**With compression** (CSMT):
```
Root -> L (jump to divergence point)
       +-- L,RR -> value1  (jump = RR)
       +-- R,RL -> value2  (jump = RL)
```

The CSMT stores only the nodes where paths actually diverge, plus "jump" metadata indicating how many levels to skip.

### CSMT Key Components

**Keys**: Sequences of directions (`L` = left = 0, `R` = right = 1). A 256-bit hash becomes a 256-element path.

**Indirect references**: Each node stores an `Indirect` value containing a `jump` (path prefix to skip) and a `value` (hash).

**Hashing**: Blake2b-256. Internal node hashes are computed by hashing the serialized left and right children.

For CSMT-specific details, see [CSMT (Binary Trie)](csmt.md).

## MPF: Merkle Patricia Forest

The MPF is a **16-ary trie** where each node branches on a hex nibble (4 bits)
rather than a single bit. This gives a much shallower tree for the same key
length: a 32-byte key produces a trie of depth 64 (nibbles) rather than 256
(bits).

### Hex Nibble Keys

Keys are represented as sequences of `HexDigit` values (0-15). A
`ByteString` key is converted to a `HexKey` by splitting each byte into its
high and low nibbles:

```
byte 0xa3 -> [HexDigit 0xa, HexDigit 0x3]
```

### 16-ary Branching

Each branch node holds a sparse 16-element array of children (one per
nibble). Path compression works similarly to CSMT: a `hexJump` field on
each `HexIndirect` node records the key suffix to skip.

Nodes are tagged as **leaf** (`hexIsLeaf = True`) or **branch**
(`hexIsLeaf = False`), which determines the hashing scheme.

### MPF Hashing

MPF uses a different hash construction from CSMT to achieve Aiken
compatibility:

- **Leaf hash**: `blake2b(hashHead || hashTail || valueDigest)` where
  `hashHead`/`hashTail` encode the suffix nibbles with even/odd length
  handling
- **Branch hash**: `blake2b(nibbleBytes(prefix) || merkleRoot(children))`
  where `merkleRoot` reduces the 16-slot sparse array via pairwise hashing
- **Merkle root**: Pairwise reduction of 16 child hashes (missing children
  use a null hash of 32 zero bytes)

For MPF-specific details, see [MPF (16-ary Trie)](mpf.md).

## Proofs

### Inclusion Proofs

An inclusion proof demonstrates that a key-value pair exists in the tree.
Both CSMT and MPF support inclusion proofs through the shared
`mtsMkProof`/`mtsVerifyProof` interface, though the internal proof
format differs.

**CSMT proofs** are CBOR-encoded and contain the key, value hash, root hash,
sibling hashes along the path, and jump paths at each level. See
[Inclusion Proof Format](architecture/inclusion-proof.md) for the wire
format specification.

**MPF proofs** use an Aiken-compatible proof-step model. The internal proof
contains step information, while the Aiken wire format carries the proof-step
list only. Browser/WASM verification therefore supplies the query key and,
for inclusion mode, the value alongside the proof bytes.

Both implementations also expose implementation-specific exclusion-proof APIs.
The browser write demos exercise those explicit exclusion witnesses for both
CSMT and MPF.

### Completeness Proofs

A completeness proof demonstrates that a set of values comprises the
entire contents of a subtree. When `treePrefix` groups entries by a
common prefix (e.g. address bytes), a completeness proof can show that
a given set of entries is **all** entries under that prefix. It consists of:

1. All leaf values under the prefix
2. A sequence of merge operations to reconstruct the subtree
3. Sibling hashes at the boundary to connect back to the root

Both CSMT and MPF implement completeness proofs (CSMT in
`CSMT.Proof.Completeness`, MPF in `MPF.Proof.Completeness`).

## Storage Model

Both implementations use a four-column storage model:

| Column | Key | Value | Purpose |
|--------|-----|-------|---------|
| KV | User key | User value | Original key-value pairs |
| Trie | Derived tree key | Node (jump + hash) | Merkle tree structure |
| Journal | User key | Tagged value | KVOnly replay log |
| Metrics | Counter name | Int | Persistent KV count / journal size |

The tree key is derived from the user key (and optionally a prefix from
the value) using the `FromKV`/`FromHexKV` conversion records. The Journal
column records mutations made in KVOnly mode for later replay against the
tree, and the Metrics column maintains transactional counters for O(1)
metrics queries.

See [Storage Layer](architecture/storage.md) for implementation-specific
details.

## Operational Modes

MTS operates in one of two modes, enforced at the type level by the
`Mode` kind and the `Ops` GADT:

- **KVOnly** — mutations write to the KV and Journal columns only.
  No tree operations are available (no root hash, no proofs). This is
  the fast-ingest mode.
- **Full** — mutations write to KV and update the CSMT/MPF tree.
  Root hash, inclusion proofs, and completeness proofs are available.

The mode is not observable from the database alone; it is tracked by
the `Ops` GADT in memory.

## Lifecycle and Transition

The `Ops` GADT provides bidirectional transitions:

- **`toFull`** (KVOnly → Full): replays journal entries against the tree
  via `patchParallel` with concurrent bucket execution, then returns
  `OpsFull`.
- **`toKVOnly`** (Full → KVOnly): verifies the journal is empty, then
  returns `OpsKVOnly`.

The `MtsTransition` record provides a managed lifecycle with a one-shot
`transitionToFull` action that locks the KVOnly store before replaying.

## Crash Safety

Each bucket transaction in the parallel replay is atomic (tree ops +
journal entry deletes in a single transaction). A **sentinel flag** in
the journal column brackets the non-atomic `toFull` sequence:

1. Write sentinel + `expandToBucketDepth` (atomic)
2. Replay loop (parallel bucket transactions)
3. `mergeSubtreeRoots` + delete sentinel (atomic)

If the process crashes between steps 1 and 3, the next `toFull` detects the
sentinel, runs `mergeSubtreeRoots` to fix the tree top, then continues
with the normal replay of remaining journal entries.

The `DbState` type exposes this as a two-state open result:

- `NeedsRecovery` — sentinel found, must run recovery first
- `Ready` — clean state, choose KVOnly or Full

## Rollbacks

The `rollbacks` library (`mts:rollbacks`) implements a swap-partition
model: every mutation is a *swap*. Inserting, updating, or deleting a
key puts a new binding into the state and yields the displaced
binding, which is the inverse operation. The store records each
rollback point's inverse log; `rollbackTo` replays those inverses in
reverse order to restore an earlier state. The model and its
correctness are formalized in Lean 4 — see `lean/Rollbacks/`
(`SwapPartition.lean` for the model, `Rollback.lean` for the proofs).
This library is independent of the CSMT/MPF trees.
