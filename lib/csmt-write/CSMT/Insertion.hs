-- Module      : CSMT.Insertion
-- Description : Insertion algorithm for Compact Sparse Merkle Trees
-- Copyright   : (c) Paolo Veronelli, 2024
-- License     : Apache-2.0
--
-- This module implements the core insertion algorithm for CSMTs.
--
-- The insertion process:
--
-- 1. Build a 'Compose' tree representing the structural changes needed
-- 2. Scan the compose tree to compute hashes and generate database operations
-- 3. Apply all operations atomically
--
-- The 'Compose' type represents a pending tree modification before hashes
-- are computed, allowing for efficient batch processing of changes.
--
-- == Batch Operations
--
-- For bulk loading into an empty tree, use 'insertingBatch' which
-- builds the tree in one pure pass using divide-and-conquer:
-- O(n log n) vs O(n²) for sequential inserts.
--
-- For parallel population, use 'insertingBucketed' which splits
-- the key space by the first @n@ bits, builds each subtree
-- independently, then merges the top levels. The subtree
-- construction is pure and can be parallelised by the caller.

-- * 'Compose' - An internal node with a jump key and two children
-- * 'Leaf' - A leaf node containing an indirect reference
--
-- This structure captures the shape of changes before hashes are computed,
-- allowing the insertion algorithm to build up the tree structure first
-- and then compute all hashes in a single pass.
